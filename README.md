- Split the extracted text into manageable chunks.
- Generate concise summaries of each text chunk using OpenAI's GPT-3.
- Convert the generated summaries into speech using text-to-speech technology.

## Dependencies

Before running the script, make sure to install the following Python libraries:

- `PyPDF2`: Used for extracting text from PDF files.
- `g4f` (third-party OpenAI library): Utilized for text summarization.
